# COS427_Final

Team Members: Jack O'Connor

Description: This project is supposed to gather articles via a web crawler
  then normalize and clean the text data. Then create train, validation,
  and test sets to be used for the Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression
  classifiers in order to create a prediction accuracy of >75%.
  
Materials: Although the project calls for it, I could not manage to get the web
  crawler working to download articles off of PubMed. So, I instead downloaded
  5 articles from each category (lyme disease, acute rheumatic arthritis, 
  cardiovascular abnormalities, and knee osteoarthritis) to use for my model.

Conclusion: Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the project as intended. 
  I spent a lot of time researching how to do the web crawler portion of the
  project and ended up not saving enough time to properly research the 
  implementation methods of the machine learning algorithms we needed to do.
