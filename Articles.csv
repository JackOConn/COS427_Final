"In this study, we present our clinical severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) experience in patients with childhood 
rheumatic disease during novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age: 
12 years; range, 6.6 to 16 years) suspected of having COVID-19 at our pediatric 
rheumatology clinic between March 11th and October 15th 2020 were 
retrospectively analyzed. Demographic and clinical features, treatments, 
laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients 
diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
(MIS-C) were retrieved from the medical records. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
infection was made based on the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
test.
RESULTS: The most common rheumatic diseases were juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
and familial Mediterranean fever (35.6% and 34.5%, respectively). Twenty-six of 
these patients were treated with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested as positive in 84 (96.5%) patients. Also, 
51 (58.6%) patients had an epidemiological contact to a person with COVID-19. 
Eighteen patients met the clinical criteria and diagnosed with MIS-C. The 
COVID-19 outbreak also caused exacerbation of systemic disease in 56 children 
due to medication cessation, postponed drug switch, or recurrent viral 
infection.
CONCLUSION: Children with rheumatic disease do not appear to present a higher 
risk of severe COVID-19. The immunosuppressive treatments can be adjusted in 
case of infection; otherwise, it is not recommended to interrupt the treatments. 
Physicians should be cautious about the hyperinflammatory syndrome associated 
with COVID-19 in rheumatic children, which may be severe in this group of 
patients and may be confused with primary diseases.",acute rheumatic arthritis
"Brazil faced a yellow fever(YF) outbreak in 2016-2018 and 
vaccination was considered for autoimmune rheumatic disease patients(ARD) with 
low immunosuppression due to YF high mortality.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate, prospectively for the first time, the 
short-term immunogenicity of the fractional YF vaccine(YFV) immunization in ARD 
patients with low immunossupression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 318 participants(159 ARD and 159 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls) were vaccinated with the fractional-dose(one 
fifth) of 17DD-YFV. All subjects were evaluated at entry(D0), D5, D10, and D30 
post-vaccination for clinical/laboratory and disease activity parameters for ARD 
patients. Post-vaccination seroconversion rate(83.7%vs.96.6%, p = 0.0006) and 
geometric mean titers(GMT) of neutralizing antibodies[1143.7 (95%CI 
1012.3-1292.2) vs.731 (95%CI 593.6-900.2), p<0.001] were significantly lower in 
ARD compared to controls. A lower positivity rate of viremia was also identified 
for ARD patients compared to controls at D5 (53%vs.70%, p = 0.005) and the 
levels persisted in D10 for patients and reduced for controls(51%vs.19%, p = 
0.0001). The viremia was the only variable associated with seroconvertion. No 
serious adverse events were reported. ARD disease activity parameters remained 
stable at D30(p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Fractional-dose 17DD-YF vaccine in ARD patients resulted in a high 
rate of seroconversion rate(>80%) but lower than controls, with a longer but 
less intense viremia. This vaccine was immunogenic, safe and did not induce 
flares in ARD under low immunosuppression and may be indicated in YF outbreak 
situations and for patients who live or travel to endemic areas.",acute rheumatic arthritis
"To present the clinical characteristics, disease course, management, 
and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with Behcet's disease (BD).
 In this retrospective cohort study, we retrieved BD patients with 
definite diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Demographic data, comorbidities, 
features related both to BD and COVID-19 infection, treatments, and outcomes 
were collected. Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization 
were performed. All statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS version 25. 
We considered p?<?0.05 statistically significant.
RESULTS: We identified 61 episodes of COVID-19 infection in 59 BD patients. The 
prevalence was 0.69%. The median age was 45 years (IQR?=?20), and the median 
disease duration was 162 months (IQR?=?195). BD features were similar except for 
higher rate of arterial involvement and positive pathergy test in infected 
patients. Thirty-five episodes (62.5%) happened in non-active patients; 39% had 
a comorbid disease. COVID manifestations were the same as the general 
population. Flu-like symptoms were the most common (85%), followed by fever 
(66%), ageusia/anosmia (56%), headache (51%), and pulmonary involvement (48%). 
There was no change in BD symptoms in 74%. Fifteen patients (25.4%) were 
hospitalized, and one patient (1.7%) died. Receiving glucocorticoids (p?<?0.03) 
and cytotoxic drugs (p?<?0.02) were associated with an increased rate of 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 infection in BD patients was not higher 
than general population in Iran. They showed milder form of disease with lower 
morbidity and mortality rate. Most were on immunosuppressive drugs, or had a 
comorbidity apart from BD. No significant effect on BD course was shown. Key 
Points ? The incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with Behcet's disease 
is not higher. ? They showed milder form of infection with lower morbidity and 
mortality rate. ? No significant effect on Behcet's disease course was shown 
with COVID19 infection. ? BD patients can be managed according to the guidelines 
used for general population.",acute rheumatic arthritis
"Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an inflammatory rheumatic disorder that 
causes chronic pain, primarily in the spine and sacroiliac joints. It is 
characterized by the presence of type 1 major histocompatibility complex HLA-B27 
genetic marker, arthritis in peripheral joints, enthesitis and/or dactylitis and 
extra-articular manifestations. Current guidelines recommend biological therapy 
when first-line therapy is not sufficiently effective. The finding that the 
interleukin (IL)-17 axis is vital for the pathogenesis of axSpA propelled the 
development of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against 
IL-17A. The present review provides evidence on the efficacy and safety of 
secukinumab in the treatment of radiographic and non-radiographic axSpA from 
nine randomized controlled phase III trials, as well as evidence from real-world 
observational analyses. The primary endpoint in six clinical trials was the 
proportion of patients meeting the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international 
Society criteria for either 20% or 40% improvement (ASAS20, ASAS40) at week 16. 
Significantly more patients achieved the primary endpoint with secukinumab 
compared with placebo in all the studies except MEASURE 4. Both clinical trials 
and real-world studies showed significant improvements in the secondary 
endpoints of disease activity, quality of life, and pain and fatigue relative to 
placebo. The benefits of secukinumab were generally sustained during longer-term 
(up to 5 years) treatment. Overall, secukinumab was well tolerated with a low 
frequency of adverse events and treatment persistence was high in the real-world 
setting. Although indirect comparisons suggest that secukinumab and adalimumab 
have comparable efficacy and safety, they are being directly compared in the 
ongoing SURPASS study. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic, it is advisable to continue biological therapy in patients who do not 
have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, but 
interrupt treatment during an infection, reinitiating once the patient has 
recovered from the infection. In conclusion, secukinumab is a largely safe and 
effective treatment for radiographic and non-radiographic axSpA.",acute rheumatic arthritis
"YouTube has become an increasingly popular educational tool and an 
important source of healthcare information. We investigated the reliability and 
quality of the information in Korean-language YouTube videos about gout.
We performed a comprehensive electronic search on April 2, 2021, using 
the following keywords-""gout,"" ""acute gout,"" ""gouty arthritis,"" ""gout 
treatment,"" and ""gout attack""-and identified 140 videos in the Korean language. 
Two rheumatologists then categorized the videos into three groups: ""useful,"" 
""misleading,"" and ""personal experience."" Reliability was determined using a 
five-item questionnaire modified from the DISCERN validation tool, and overall 
quality scores were based on the Global Quality Scale (GQS).
RESULTS: Among the 140 videos identified, 105 (75.0%), 29 (20.7%), and 6 (4.3%) 
were categorized as ""useful,"" ""misleading,"" and ""personal experience,"" 
respectively. Most videos in the ""useful"" group were created by rheumatologists 
(70.5%). The mean DISCERN and GQS scores in the ""useful"" group (3.3  1.0 and 
3.8  0.7) were higher than those in the ""misleading"" (0.9  1.0 and 1.9  0.6) 
and ""personal experience"" groups (0.8  1.2 and 2.0  0.8) (P < 0.001 for both 
the DISCERN and GQS tools).
CONCLUSION: Approximately 75% of YouTube videos that contain educational 
material regarding gout were useful; however, we observed some inaccuracies in 
the medical information provided. Healthcare professionals should closely 
monitor media content and actively participate in the development of videos that 
provide accurate medical information.",acute rheumatic arthritis
"The overall failure rate of standard therapeutic options for 
late/chronic/persistent borreliosis emphasizes the need for novel therapeutic 
strategies. In this report, we are presenting a novel therapeutic option based 
on a new technology, Induced Native Phage Therapy (INPT; PhagenCorp, LLC, 
Sarasota, FL), and its ability to facilitate the elimination of infection more 
rapidly, efficiently, and with less harm to the patient than conventional 
treatments. Borrelia species in the environment are themselves always infected 
by their own type of Borrelia bacteriophages. Both the Borrelia spirochete and 
the Borrelia bacteriophages are transmitted into humans via the bite of a 
vector, such as ticks. The Borrelia bacteriophages (phages) are called native 
phages in that they coexist naturally within the human body, and only infect the 
specific bacteria host population. Native phages persist in humans only as long 
as there are host bacteria of the correct type to continue replicating more 
phages. The purposeful manipulation of native phages to kill their host bacteria 
is the basis of INPT. INPT is a patent-pending technology that uses a 
proprietary adjunctive assay called Biospectral Emission Sequencing to identify 
and isolate the specific complex electromagnetic signatures necessary to induce 
the native phages to epigenetically revert from their normal quiescent, 
lysogenic activity to virulent, lytic activity, thereby killing their host 
bacteria.The strategic subtle, low-frequency/low-energy signatures are 
imprinted into a proprietary oral formula, Inducen-LD, which serves as a carrier 
to introduce the signals therapeutically into the body. As a proof-of-concept 
method validation, a total of 26 patients with post-treatment (antibiotic) Lyme 
disease syndrome, who initially were found upon Phelix Borrelia-phage testing 
(R.E.D. Laboratories, Belgium) to have one or more Borrelia species, were 
submitted to INPT treatment. A total of 20 patients (77%) were found to be 
negative after two weeks of the total program of care. Six patients who remained 
positive after the initial therapy received an extended INPT treatment and were 
retested. Four were subsequently found to be negative for one or more of their 
previously diagnosed Borrelia strains. Thus a total of 24 out of 26 (92%) 
patients were successfully treated with INPT. Mild to substantial clinical 
improvements were reported by all participants without noticeable adverse 
reactions to the INPT treatments. We have demonstrated a possible mechanism in 
which native bacteriophages can be induced to epigenetically switch from 
lysogenic to lytic actions, thereby eliminating the targeted bacteria 
efficiently, with little to no harm to tissues or the microbiome.",lyme disease
"The Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genogroup is the 
causative agent responsible for Lyme borreliosis, a common tick-borne infectious 
disease in some temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In humans, the 
clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis vary from dermatological infection 
to severe systemic manifestations. In Romania, data on the seroprevalence of 
Lyme borreliosis and associated risk factors are scarce and outdated, as the 
only seroprevalence study with a large dataset was published more than 20 years 
ago. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the seroprevalence 
for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. in healthy blood donors from six Romanian counties 
and identify the associated risk factors.
METHODS: The study was conducted among 1200 healthy blood donors aged between 18 
and 65 years during November 2019 and September 2020 from six counties in the 
northwestern and central parts of Romania. A two-tiered testing strategy was 
applied. Positive and equivocal immunoenzymatic test results for IgG and IgM 
antibodies were further confirmed by Western blot.
RESULTS: Serum samples from 20% of the blood donors had positive or equivocal 
IgG and IgM ELISA index values. In total, 2.3% of the serum samples for IgG and 
1.8% for IgM were positive by Western blot. The seroprevalence for both 
antibodies varied between 1.5% (Satu-Mare) and 6.5% (Bistri?a-N?s?ud) in the six 
counties investigated. The highest seroprevalence was observed in men (4.7%), in 
blood donors performing their professional activities outdoors (4.2%), and in 
those aged? ?56 years (8%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the presence of specific IgG and IgM 
antibodies to B. burgdorferi s.l. among healthy blood donors from Romania. 
Furthermore, potential risk factors, such as gender, age, and behavior, 
associated with the presence of positive B. burgdorferi s.l. antibodies among 
healthy blood donors were identified.",lyme disease
"Prior studies have demonstrated that Lyme disease is frequently 
over-diagnosed. However, few studies describe which conditions are misdiagnosed 
as Lyme disease.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study evaluated patients 
referred for Lyme disease to a Mid-Atlantic academic center between 2000-2013 
who lacked evidence for Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The primary outcome is 
clinically described diagnoses contributing to symptoms. Secondary outcomes 
included symptom duration and determination whether diagnoses were new or 
attributed to existing medical conditions.
RESULTS: Of 1261 referred patients, 1061 (84%) had no findings of active Lyme 
disease, with 690 (65%) receiving other diagnoses resulting in 405 (59%) having 
newly diagnosed medical conditions, 134 (19%) attributed to pre-existing medical 
issues, and 151 (22%) had both new and pre-existing conditions. Among the 690 
patients, the median symptom duration was 796 days, and a total of 139 discrete 
diagnoses were made. Infectious disease diagnoses comprised only 3.2%. Leading 
diagnoses were anxiety/depression 222 (21%), fibromyalgia 120 (11%), chronic 
fatigue syndrome 77 (7%), migraine disorder 74 (7%), osteoarthritis 62 (6%) and 
sleep disorder/apnea 48 (5%). Examples of less frequent but non-syndromic 
diseases newly diagnosed included multiple sclerosis (11), malignancy (8), 
Parkinson's disease (8), sarcoidosis (4) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4).
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with long-term symptoms have either new or 
pre-existing disorders accounting for their symptoms other than Lyme disease, 
suggesting overdiagnosis in this population. Patients referred for consideration 
of Lyme disease for chronic symptoms deserve careful assessment for diagnoses 
other than Borrelia burgdorferi infection.",lyme disease
"Ticks and tick-borne diseases represent a growing public health threat in North 
America and Europe. The number of ticks, their geographical distribution, and 
the incidence of tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease, are all on the rise. 
Accurate, real-time tick-image identification through a smartphone app or 
similar platform could help mitigate this threat by informing users of the risks 
associated with encountered ticks and by providing researchers and public health 
agencies with additional data on tick activity and geographic range. Here we 
outline the requirements for such a system, present a model that meets those 
requirements, and discuss remaining challenges and frontiers in automated tick 
identification. We compiled a user-generated dataset of more than 12,000 images 
of the three most common tick species found on humans in the U.S.: Amblyomma 
americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis. We used image 
augmentation to further increase the size of our dataset to more than 90,000 
images. Here we report the development and validation of a convolutional neural 
network which we call ""TickIDNet,"" that scores an 87.8% identification accuracy 
across all three species, outperforming the accuracy of identifications done by 
a member of the general public or healthcare professionals. However, the model 
fails to match the performance of experts with formal entomological training. We 
find that image quality, particularly the size of the tick in the image 
(measured in pixels), plays a significant role in the network's ability to 
correctly identify an image: images where the tick is small are less likely to 
be correctly identified because of the small object detection problem in deep 
learning. TickIDNet's performance can be increased by using confidence 
thresholds to introduce an ""unsure"" class and building image submission 
pipelines that encourage better quality photos. Our findings suggest that deep 
learning represents a promising frontier for tick identification that should be 
further explored and deployed as part of the toolkit for addressing the public 
health consequences of tick-borne diseases.",lyme disease
"
With the incidence of Lyme and other tickborne diseases on the rise in the US 
and globally, there is a critical need for data-driven tools that communicate 
the magnitude of this problem and help guide public health responses. We present 
the Johns Hopkins Lyme and Tickborne Disease Dashboard 
(https://www.hopkinslymetracker.org/), a new tool that harnesses the power of 
geography to raise awareness and fuel research and scientific collaboration. The 
dashboard is unique in applying a geographic lens to tickborne diseases, aiming 
not only to become a global tracker of tickborne diseases but also to 
contextualize their complicated geography with a comprehensive set of maps and 
spatial data sets representing a One Health approach. We share our experience 
designing and implementing the dashboard, describe the main features, and

"Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in Chagas disease (ChD) 
is relatively common and its treatment using low-cost drugs can improve symptoms 
and reduce mortality. Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG 
algorithm showed excellent accuracy to detect LVSD in a general population, but 
its accuracy in ChD has not been tested.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of AI to recognize LVSD in patients with ChD, 
defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the Echocardiogram 
40%.
This is a cross-sectional study of ECG obtained 
from a large cohort of patients with ChD named S?o Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical 
Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) Study. The digital ECGs of the participants 
were submitted to the analysis of the trained machine to detect LVSD. The 
diagnostic performance of the AI-enabled ECG to detect LVSD was tested using an 
echocardiogram as the gold standard to detect LVSD, defined as an ejection 
fraction <40%. The model was enriched with NT-proBNP plasma levels, male sex, 
and QRS 120ms. Among the 1,304 participants of this study, 67% were women, 
median age of 60; there were 93 (7.1%) individuals with LVSD. Most patients had 
major ECG abnormalities (59.5%). The AI algorithm identified LVSD among ChD 
patients with an odds ratio of 63.3 (95% CI 32.3-128.9), a sensitivity of 73%, a 
specificity of 83%, an overall accuracy of 83%, and a negative predictive value 
of 97%; the AUC was 0.839. The model adjusted for the male sex and QRS 120ms 
improved the AUC to 0.859. The model adjusted for the male sex and elevated 
NT-proBNP had a higher accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.874.
The AI analysis of the ECG of Chagas disease patients can be 
transformed into a powerful tool for the recognition of LVSD.",cardiovascular abnormalities
"Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA)

assessment of both epicardial and microvascular coronary compartments within the 
context of an acute myocardial infarction, several recent evidence support the 
critical role of a comprehensive invasive functional assessment in order to 
identify the underlying pathophysiological mechanism and consequently to select 
an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Unfortunately, optimal medical therapy for 
these patients is not currently established due to the lack of dedicated trials

"Cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion imaging during vasodilator 
stress is an established modality in patients with suspected and known coronary 
artery disease (CAD). Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of 
fast-Strain-Encoded-MRI (fast-SENC) for the diagnostic classification and risk 
stratification of patients with ischemic heart disease. Methods: Perfusion and 
fast-SENC cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images were retrospectively analyzed 
in 111 patients who underwent stress CMR. The average myocardial perfusion score 
index, global and segmental longitudinal and circumferential strain (GLS and GCS 
and SLS and SCS, respectively), were measured at rest and during stress. The 
combination of SLS and SCS was referred to as segmental aggregate strain (SAS). 
Segments exhibiting perfusion defects or SAS impairment during stress were 
defined as ""ischemic."" All-cause mortality, non-fatal infarction, and urgent 
revascularization were deemed as our combined clinical endpoint. Results: During 
adenosine stress testing, 44 of 111 (39.6%) patients exhibited inducible 
perfusion abnormalities. During a mean follow-up of 1.94 0.65 years, 25 
(22.5%) patients reached the combined endpoint (death in n = 2, infarction in n 
= 3 and urgent revascularization in n = 20). Inducible perfusion defects were 
associated with higher number of segments with inducible SAS reduction 6.5% (?2 
= 37.8, AUC = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71-0.87, p < 0.001). In addition, patients with 
inducible perfusion defects or SAS impairment exhibited poorer outcomes (AUCPerf 
= 0.81 vs. AUCSAS = 0.74, p = NS vs. each other, and ?2 = 30.8, HR = 10.3 and ?2 
= 9.5, HR = 3.5, respectively, p < 0.01 for both). Conclusion: Purely 
quantitative strain analysis by fast-SENC during vasodilator stress was related 
to the diagnosis of ischemia by first-pass perfusion and is non-inferior for the 
risk stratification of patients with ischemic heart disease. This may bear 
clinical implications, especially in patients with contraindications for

"OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we retrospectively reviewed the difference in clinical 
effectiveness of shock wave therapy and electroacupuncture therapy on knee 
osteoarthritis.
METHODS: A total of 128 treatment cases of knee osteoarthritis patients were 
extracted from the medical record system of Shenzhen Longhua District Central 
Hospital during the period from January 1, 2018, to January 30, 2020. The cases 
were divided into three groups for different treatments: shock wave group (n = 
54), electroacupuncture group (n = 41), and control group (n = 33). The shock 
wave group was given shock wave therapy combined basis clinical treatment; 
meanwhile, the electroacupuncture group was given electroacupuncture on the 
basis of actual clinical treatment. The control group was given conventional 
topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Voltaren). Osteoarthritis index 
scale, NRS scale, and WHOQOL-BREF were observed before treatment, after 2 weeks, 
and 4 weeks after treatment.
RESULTS: This study found that the osteoarthritis index scale and NRS scale of 
the shock wave group and the electroacupuncture group were lower than those 
before treatment; it had significant difference (P < 0.001). In WHOQOL-BREF, the 
shock wave group and the electroacupuncture group improved significantly four 
weeks after treatment (P < 0.001), which was statistically different from the 
conventional group (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Physical and rehabilitation medicine treatment (shock wave therapy) 
and traditional medical treatment (electroacupuncture) have better clinical 
effects on knee osteoarthritis, compared with conventional treatment. Shock wave 
and electric acupuncture have no apparent adverse reaction, suggesting that the 
treatment is safe and effective.",knee osteoarthritis
"Bisphosphonate has great potential in KOA therapy, but whether the 
anti-resorption mechanism of bisphosphonate aggravates sclerosis of subchondral 
bone remains unclear. We found that bisphosphonate use did not increase 
sclerosis of subchondral bone in established KOA, perhaps resolving some 
concerns about bisphosphonate in patients with KOA. Introduction: Most studies 
have focused on the protective effect of bisphosphonate on early knee 
osteoarthritis (KOA) through its anti-resorption mechanism in osteoclasts. 
However, late KOA has a decreased rate of resorption, which is the opposite of 
early KOA. The risk of subchondral bone sclerosis in late KOA after using 
bisphosphonate has not been investigated using morphometry. Methods: Forty-five 
patients who had ever used bisphosphonate (or 33 patients with current use) were 
matched with controls through propensity matching methods, including age, body 
mass index (BMI), sex, health status (12-Item Short Form Survey physical health 
score), physical activity level (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly score), 
vitamin D use, and calcium use. At the baseline and 12-month (or 18-month) 
follow-up, bone mineral density (BMD) of the tibia and hip was measured by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and medial tibial subchondral bone 
morphometry: bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), 
trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) were calculated 
based on 3-T trabecular MRI. Data were obtained from the Bone Ancillary Study in 
the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) project. Results: The yearly percentage 
change in hip BMD of the current bisphosphonate-use group was significantly 
greater than that of the non-bisphosphonate-use group (0.7% vs. -1%, P = 0.02). 
The other outcomes (BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, Tb.Th, tibia medial BMD, and tibia 
lateral BMD) between the two groups presented no significant difference. The 
non-bisphosphonate-use group experienced a significant increase in Tb.Th [2%, 
95% CI = (1%, 4%), P = 0.01], while the bisphosphonate-use group presented no 
significant change [1%, 95% CI = (-2%, 4%), P = 0.54]. Conclusions: 
Bisphosphonate use did not increase sclerosis of subchondral bone in established 
KOA. Bisphosphonate might have a stage-dependent effect on subchondral bone in 
KOA initiation and progression.",knee osteoarthritis
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a significant cause of disability. Considering the 
increasing diffusion of the viscosupplementation (VS) with hyaluronic acid (HA), 
the International Symposium Intra Articular Treatment (ISIAT) appointed a 
Technical Expert Panel (TEP) to identify the criteria for successful VS with a 
specific HA in OA; this through a systematic literature review (SLR), performed 
following the PRISMA guidelines interrogating Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Grey Matters 
and American College of Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) databases and the opinion of 
international experts. The research included only studies on adults and humans 
without limitations of language or time of publication. Researchers extracted 
both quantitative and qualitative data from each study. Mixed Methods Appraisal 
Tool (MMAT) was used to perform quality analysis for the level of evidence. The 
SLR retrieved 385 papers, 25 of which were suitable for the analysis. The TEP 
focused on the different formulations of the product Sinovial? [HA 0.8%, HA 
1.6%, HA 2%, 800-1200 kDa, HA 3.2% (1400-2100 kDa/65-110 kDa)]. The choice was 
due to the vast amount of evidence available. The TEP weighed the evidence in 
two rounds of a Delphi survey; the results, and any disagreement, were discussed 
in a final session. Three domains were considered: 1) the patients' 
characteristics associated with the best results; 2) the contraindications and 
the conditions linked to increased risk of failure; 3) the clinical conditions 
in which VS is considered appropriate. The TEP concluded that VS with HA is safe 
and effective in the treatment of knee and hip OA of grades I to III and that it 
is possible to undertake VS in other situations (eg grade IV Kellgren-Lawrence - 
KL); a comprehensive examination of the patient should be performed before the 
procedure.",knee osteoarthritis
"PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is widely used as a treatment for knee 
osteoarthritis. Few studies have analysed the factors affecting the squatting 
ability of patients after TKA. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively 
analyse the factors affecting squatting ability after TKA and to determine which 
ones are important.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred primary TKA cases with a minimum 3-year 
follow-up were retrospectively analysed. All patients received a conventional 
posterior-stabilized TKA implant and underwent a standard perioperative care 
pathway. The patients were divided into two groups according to the squatting 
position and knee flexion angle while weight-bearing (Group I - inability to 
squat group, Group II - ability to squat group). Demographic, operative, and 
clinical data were collected. Radiographic assessment included joint line 
elevation, patellar position, posterior condylar offset (PCO), etc. Statistical 
analysis of the effect of all the above factors on squatting ability was 
performed.
RESULTS: The preoperative range of motion and joint line of Group I were 
82.9 12.6 and 3.24 1.07, respectively, and those of Group II were 107 9.6 and 
1.83 0.89 respectively. The univariate analysis showed that age, prosthesis 
size, preoperative ROM and joint line position were correlated with squatting 
ability. But in the final multivariate analysis, joint line position and 
preoperative ROM were independent influencing factors that affected squatting 
ability after TKA (p value < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Preoperative ROM and joint line position were independent 
influencing factors affecting squatting ability after TKA. Patients should be 
counseled accordingly and be made to understand these factors. To ensure that 
patients can squat postoperatively, we should improve surgical techniques to 
control joint line elevation.",knee osteoarthritis
"BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D levels are associated with a more severe case of knee 
osteoarthritis (OA). However, there are few published reports concerning an 
association between vitamin D deficiency and functional status of individuals 
with OA and no reports about postural balance in this population.
AIM: To analyze the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and severity, 
functional status, and balance in elderly patients with OA.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 105 elderly patients with hip and knee 
OA were included. The severity was assessed by the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria. 
The functional status was assessed with the Lequesne index. Postural balance was 
assessed using a force platform, and center-of-pressure parameters (velocity at 
anteroposterior and mediolateral axis) were used as the balance outcomes. Serum 
25(OH) vitamin D levels were measured using a chemiluminescence method.
RESULTS: Most of the patients (mean age: 70.6 6.5 years) were female (n = 78, 
74.3%). In the group with vitamin D deficiency, 43 patients (56.6%) had severe 
OA, while 33 patients (43.4%) had mild or moderate OA (? 2 test, P = 0.04). 
Patients with vitamin D deficiency showed a higher Lequesne index score 
(Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.04), indicating a worse functional impairment when 
compared to individuals with normal vitamin D levels. Additionally, patients 
with vitamin D deficiency had worse postural balance according to the 
Mann-Whitney test (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with worse severity, functional 
status, and postural balance in patients with OA.",knee osteoarthritis
